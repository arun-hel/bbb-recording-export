![BigBlueButton Recording Exporter - render into mp4 file](https://i.imgur.com/CjSFtzi.png "BBB video meeting exporter")

  
  

## What's coming?

üîú Integration into BBB and Greenlight's UI<br  />

üîú Faster, less resource-intensive exports<br  />

  

## Usage
Place the files `render_chat.rb`, `render_cursor.rb`, and `render_whiteboard.rb` in `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/post_publish` with executable rights.

BBB sessions will then automatically be exported as a `meeting.mp4` file, which can be accessed and downloaded at https://`your.bbb.hostname`/presentation/`meeting-id`/meeting.mp4

The meeting's ID is the alphanumeric string following the 2.3 in the recording's URL.

Existing recordings can be rebuilt to run the exporting scripts automatically again.
 
## Requirements
Access to a functioning BBB 2.3 server. <br  />

## Disclaimer
As this project is still a work in progress, long BBB sessions or meetings that contain a large amount of chat messages / whiteboard annotations may take up a lot of hard disk space and be slow to render. The contents of the created scratch folders are **not** automatically deleted.

A license may be needed for the generated .mp4 files.
